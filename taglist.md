This is meant to be a central list of all active tags. Do not add tags to pages that don't appear here first.

# Core & Non-Core

These tags are intended to be temporary and internal use to denote if a page is a primary focus or not. Core pages are considered essential while non-core pages are considered "nice to have" but not essential for the initial site.

# Medical

These pages deal with medical procedures, drugs, and other treatments to one's physical body.

## HRT

These pages deal with hormones and puberty blockers. It is possible that this will eventually be moved under a more generic "drugs" or "long-term care" tag.

## Procedures

These pages deal with medical procedures that are more-or-less one time procedures. (Or one-time for a portion of the body.)

# Legal

These pages deal with rights that are strictly legal such as name changes or access to facilities.

# Culture

These pages deal with more general cultural issues that shouldn't or can't be simply legislated.

# WIP

This is to denote a page is a "Work In Progress" but is considered complete enough for browsing. That is to say past draft status but prior to full publication. It's unlikely to be commonly used outside of extremely large or broad articles that can't otherwise be broken up.
