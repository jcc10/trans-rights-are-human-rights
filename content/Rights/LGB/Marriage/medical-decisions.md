### Notes
This is intended to explain how many hospitals only accept marriage to allow a spouse to make medical decisions for their partner if they are severely injured, to the point where they have been known to reach out to No-Contact family members who have been removed for multiple years, and allow them to make the decisions, up to and including cutting life support.
