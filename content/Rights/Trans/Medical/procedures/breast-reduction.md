## STUB
This page is a stub and needs to be filled out.
### Notes
This page is to note how Breast Reduction Gender Affirming Care is commonly used for Cis-Boys and Cis-Men who have gynecomastia.

It should also probably note how some Cis-Women get Breast Reduction for various reasons (not always medical) and how they can get looked down on because of that. (And how that is also not good.)
