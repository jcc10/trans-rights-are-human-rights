## STUB
This page is a stub and needs to be filled out.
### Notes
This page is an anomaly as it's intended to point out how transvestigations have far more false-positives where they harass cis-women using the restrooms than actually "catching" trans-women using the restrooms. Up to and including boyfriends entering the wwomenrestrooms to try and "protect" their girlfriends.
